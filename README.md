# SL9Design
portfolio 


I'm redesigning my portfolio to be able to switch to several different original themes, using Angular.js to populate the sections so I can update my portfolio easily across all current and future themes.   
Each new design is inspired by albums by my favorite band, The Divine Comedy. I've started with a goal of 5 (plus my original portfolio design), but I may just keep going and do all of their albums someday!

Currently working on:
Casanova - complete 5/5/16
Liberation
Fin De Siecle
Regeneration
Bang Goes the Knighthood

And someday:
Absent Friends
Victory for the Comic Muse
Promenade
A Short Album about Love
A Secret History
Fanfare for the Comic Muse
And whatever the next one is called!
